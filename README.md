Given the following image, I was tasked to replicate a similar sign up form.

## New Things Learnt ##

- [x] Use of keyframes to make minor animations e.g. password validation and button hover
- [x] Adding classes to error messages makes it easier to remove them so that the message does not keep repeatedly getting inserted by the DOM.


## Things to do to improve my attempt ##
- [ ] Responsive styling
- [ ] Adding more validation to the fields, currently only applied to the password.
    -[ ] First name required
    -[ ] Email required
    -[ ] Phone number required (?)
    -[ ] Adding RegEx for pattern validation
